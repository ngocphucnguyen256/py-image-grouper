An app which can divide images to folders depends on images aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). 

Ex: Pool folder is the folder hold all images
After run
 horizontal images move to Horizontal folder
 vertical images move to Vertical folder

Should have revert function to undo moved

May be provide an UI for easier use. 
Pool, Horizontal and Vertical folders can be located via path
Write it in python and export it to an exe file. The source code should be in SourceCode folder


Can auto generate some example images for testing
